# I want to introduce you to my projects :blush:

This - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Embarg0o/Embarg0o.github.io) contains multiple projects: 

- **Project 1**: 
  - Directory: `FilmRating Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews`
  - Description: This project creates a computer model that helps determine whether movie reviews are positive or negative. We download reviews, clean and process them, and then train the model to recognize positive and negative reviews. At the end, we check how well the model copes with this task.

- **Project 2**: 
  - Directory: `Parkinson's Disease Prediction with XGBoost`
  - Description: This project creates a computer model that helps determine whether a patient has Parkinson's disease based on their medical data. We load the data, process it and divide it into training and test sets. We then train the model using XGBoost and check how accurately it can predict the presence of the disease.

- **Project 3**: 
  - Directory: `Fake News Detection with Machine Learning`
  - Description: 
This project creates a computer model that helps determine whether a news story is real or fake with high accuracy. We load the data, process the news text, split it into training and test sets, train the model using the `sklearn` library, and check how accurately it can recognize fake news.

- **Project 4**: 
  - Directory: `Neuro-travel agent`
  - Description: 
This project creates a neural agent that can interact with users and provide information about the role of a travel agent in the tourism industry. We download data from Google Docs, process it and save it into a vector database. The neural agent uses language analysis models from OpenAI to answer user questions based on stored information.
